# Ideas-for-Fiction
A collection of characters, scenes, monsters, all sorts of odd ideas I collect through time to maybe do something with later.

# Characters
- Crustacean King - Old Sea warrior lord, aged to the point of sea wildlife growing through him, large crab like shells across his back and head
  
# Monsters & Enemies
- 'Willowing Widow' - Creature, tree base with female human torso/upper. Lady mourning loss of husband, ran to the woods and sat crying for so long a tree grew around her.
- Robot Crow - https://www.youtube.com/shorts/QmaNBj20jcw?feature=share
- Mutated, giant fly freature, either magic or sci-fi
